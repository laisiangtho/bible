      "description": "Version Information The Common English Bible is unlike any other translation. It’s uncommon in that it’s the newest translation by the largest number of biblical scholars & church leaders in words 21st century readers use every day, aligning academic rigor with modern understandability, proven through extensive affirmation with, and acting on feedback from, hundreds of readers. The new Common English Bible is the only translation to combine and balance highly respected ecumenical biblical scholarship necessary for serious study with responsiveness to 21st century clear communication requirements for comprehensive clarity. The Common English Bible is the result of collaboration between opposites: scholars working with average readers; conservatives working with liberals; teens working with retirees; men working with women; many denominations and many ethnicities coming together around the common goal of creating a translation that unites rather than divides, with the ultimate goal of mutually accomplishing God’s overall work in the world. Combining scholarly accuracy with vivid language, the Common English Bible is the work of 120 biblical scholars from 24 denominations in American, African, Asian, European, and Latino communities, representing such academic institutions as Asbury Theological Seminary, Azusa Pacific University, Bethel Seminary, Denver Seminary, Princeton Theological Seminary, Seattle Pacific University, Wheaton College, Yale University, and many others. They meticulously translated the Bible into English directly from the original Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek texts. Additionally, more than 500 readers in 77 groups field-tested the translation. Every verse was read aloud in the reading groups, where potentially confusing passages were identified. The translators considered the groups' responses and, where necessary, reworked those passages to clarify in English their meaning from the original languages. In total, more than 600 people worked jointly to bring the Common English Bible to fruition. The digital revolution is accelerating changes in language and its everyday usage. The new Common English Bible is written in contemporary idiom at the same reading level as the newspaper USA TODAY—using language that’s comfortable and accessible for today’s English readers. This new translation strives to make Bible reading more clear and compelling for individuals, groups, and corporate worship services. In 2010 the New Testament was published. In 2011 the complete Bible was published with the Old Testament and the availability of the Apocrypha.

      "description": "Contemporary English Version (Anglicised)  The Contemporary English Version (CEV) is a fresh and clear Bible translation, first produced by the American Bible Society (ABS) in 1995. This CEV was especially developed for use in Church, outreach and evangelism and is suitable for people of all ages and educational background. The translation is readable, understandable and accessible. In 1997 the British and Foreign Bible Society (BFBS) anglicised the text for the U.K. and Commonwealth but which also uses metric measurements. This is called the Contemporary English Version (Anglicised) or CEVUK.  The Contemporary English Version (CEV) was designed to be a Bible which is easily understood when read aloud. Most of the usual biblical terminology has been adapted into everyday language, to make it readable by people without a church background. As a result of this it won the coveted Crystal Award in 1996 from the Plain English Campaign, which is awarded to publications that are considered to be as clear as possible for the intended audience. This makes the CEV a great translation for youth Bibles.  Audio Version  In 2010 the Contemporary English Version was the translation used in Bible Society's You’ve Got the Time New Testament dramatised audio recording by the Riding Lights Theatre Company. The CEV is also the translation of choice for special highlighted editions such as the Poverty and Justice Bible and The Highlighted Freedom Bible. Contemporary English Version.

      "description": "The Christian Standard Bible aims to draw readers into a deeper, more meaningful relationship with God. By translating Scripture into the clearest possible modern English, the CSB allows readers to experience God’s Word at its fullest. Developed by 100 scholars from 17 denominations, the Christian Standard Bible faithfully and accurately captures the Bible’s original meaning without compromising readability. The CSB was created using Optimal Equivalence, a translation philosophy that balances linguistic precision to the original languages and readability in contemporary English. In the many places throughout Scripture where a word-for-word rendering is clearly understandable, a literal translation is used. When a word-for-word rendering might obscure the meaning for a modern audience, a more dynamic translation is used. This process assures that both the words and thoughts contained in the original text are conveyed as accurately as possible for today’s readers.The CSB provides a highly accurate text for sermon preparation and serious study, translated from the biblical languages by scholars who love God’s Word. Yet it doesn’t compromise readability and clarity for those who may be less familiar with the traditional (and sometimes difficult) vocabulary retained in some translations. Research shows the CSB is both highly literal to the original languages and highly readable, achieving an optimal balance of the two. Pastors and laypeople can read and share the Christian Standard Bible with confidence, knowing truth of God’s Word will be communicated effectively. For a more information, visit CSBible.com",

      "description": "John Nelson Darby  John Nelson Darby, sometimes known as JND, was born in London in 1800. He graduated in 1818 from Trinity College, Dublin, with Honours and the University Medal in Classics. In 1825 he was ordained as a deacon of the Anglican Church of Ireland, and in 1826 became a priest. However later he became a leader of the Plymouth Brethren movement. In the 1830s and 1840s he worked in Christian ministry and pastoral care in England, Ireland, France, Germany and Switzerland and elsewhere. He was a linguist, learned in Hebrew, Greek, Latin, French and German. He died in Bournemouth in 1882.  Darby New Testament 1871  Darby translated the New Testament into English from Greek, published in 1867 as “The Holy Scriptures: A New Translation from the Original Languages by J. N. Darby” and revised in 1871. His translation included footnotes on variant texts. After Darby died in 1882 the final edition was published in 1884. With the help of brethren, Darby also translated the Bible into French and German.  Darby Bible 1890  After Darby's death some of his students created the English Old Testament based on Darby's French (Pau) and German (Elberfelder) translations from the Masoretic Hebrew text. The complete Darby Bible in English was first published in 1890. The Darby Bible is a fairly literal, word-for-word translation, which adheres closely to the Hebrew and Greek in tense and structure. In the Old Testament Jehovah is used to translate the Hebrew YHWH, and Elohim is translated as God, Eloah is translated +God, and El is translated as ·God.  Digital Edition  The text, including many critical text notes, was digitised for the British and Foreign Bible Society (BFBS) in 2012, who maintain the text.  It was last updated in 2020.",

      "description": "The purpose of the EasyEnglish Bible is to make the Bible as clear as possible in simple English. We have used a basic vocabulary of 1200 well-known English words. It is a very good Bible for anyone who is learning English or speaks English as a foreign language.  EasyEnglish Website To help you even more, the EasyEnglish Bible website – www.easyenglish.bible – has Commentaries and Bible Studies to help you understand the message of the Bible and apply it to your life.  Translation Principles To make the Bible as easy as possible to understand, we have used:  Short sentences Short paragraphs Simple grammar  We have avoided things that can be hard to understand, so we have used:  No passive verbs No idioms No split infinitives No rhetorical questions  The EasyEnglish Bible is a “meaning-for-meaning” translation not a “word-for-word” translation.  It expresses the meaning of the original message in the most clear, accurate and natural way possible in simple English. It changes the order of words if that makes the meaning clearer in English. It translates the meaning of idioms rather than the literal words. It uses British spelling, grammar and punctuation.  These translation principles have been developed by Wycliffe Bible Translators (WBT) and SIL.  EasyEnglish Translation Team The EasyEnglish Bible has been translated by MissionAssist, which is a Christian charity based in the United Kingdom. MissionAssist is part of the Wycliffe Global Alliance (WGA) and a member of Global Connections. The EasyEnglish Bible translation team includes:  Linguistic Checkers - People who check the linguistic consistency of the work. Our linguistic checkers normally have a degree in Linguistics or English (or similar) and a TEFL qualification. Theological Checkers - People who check the theological accuracy of the work. Our theological checkers have a degree in theology (or a similar qualification). Style Checkers - People who check drafts and final output for accuracy, consistency and conformance to EasyEnglish principles.   The Base Text We have used a range of English Bible translations as a base. Where English versions have a different understanding of the original text, we have referred to the Hebrew or Greek text, using the texts published and updated by United Bible Societies (UBS):  Old Testament: Biblia Hebraica “Masoretic Text” New Testament: The Nestle-Aland “Novum Testamentum Graece”  We also use the resources provided by Wycliffe Bible Translators to help translators and checkers understand the issues involved in translating the original texts.

Mais elle reprit de la popularité vers la fin du 20ème siècle avec l’édition 1996. Toutefois cette dernière manque de précision et de fidélité au Texte Original du Nouveau Testament ou Texte Reçu, c’est pourquoi nous avons trouvé bon de mettre enligne ici l’édition 1877 original de la Bible Ostervald afin de donner aux fidèles un outil de comparaison grandement nécessaire. Vous allez trouver que l’édition 1877 de l’Ostervald est vastement supérieure à l’édition 1996, et si vous devez absolument utiliser l’Ostervald pour vos études nous vous conseillons fortement celle de 1877.",
